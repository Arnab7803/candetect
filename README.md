# Candetect: Your One-Stop Solution for Skin Cancer Detection
Skin cancer is a prevalent form of cancer that can have serious consequences if not detected early. With the increasing incidence of skin cancer cases, there is a growing need for accessible and accurate methods of early detection to improve skin health outcomes. Introducing Candetect, a web-app that aims to provide a one-stop solution for skin cancer detection.

Our team at Candetect has conduced extensive research in the field of skin cancer detection to develop an innovative and user-friendly web-app. Leveraging the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence, our app is designed to provide reliable and accurate results for the classification of skin lesions as malignant or benign.

## Features
One of the key insights from our research is the importance of using a diverse and large dataset for training our machine learning model. Our team has collected and curated a comprehensive dataset of skin lesion images from various sources to ensure that our model is robust and reliable. This dataset has been used to train our machine learning model, enabling it to learn and recognize patterns associated with different types of skin cancers.

One of the standout features of Candetect is its user-friendly interface. Our app provides a simple and intuitive platform for users to upload images of their skin lesions for analysis. The process is quick and easy, requiring minimal technical expertise. Users can upload images from their devices and receive automated classification results within seconds, saving precious time in the detection process.


### Prerequisites
We have used HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT for the web-app . For the authentication , we have used firebase app. For the app interface , we have used flutter . For ML model deployment, we have used Vertex AI tool in Google cloud .
